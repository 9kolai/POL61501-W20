					<section>
						<h2>New Institutionalism(s) </h2>
						<p class="fragment">Developed in 1980/90's in response to behavioural perspectives that dominated the 1960/70's. </p>
						<p class="fragment">Peter Hall and Rosemary Taylor sums up development and identify three different areas of research that is concerned with institutions. </p>
						<p class="fragment">Each of these have distinct answers to the following questions: </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">What are institutions? </li>
							<li class="fragment">How does institutions relate to (individual) behaviour? </li>
							<li class="fragment">How and where do institutions origin? </li>
							<li class="fragment">How do institutions change and/or persist? </li>
						</ul>

					<h3 style="color: rgb(0,101,189)">Historical Institutionalism </h3>
					<section>
						<h2>Origins </h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Conflict between groups for scarce resources at the heart of politics. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Influenced by structural functionalists: See polity as an overall system of interacting parts. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Comparative studies of public policies in different nations, focusing on impact of national political institutions. </li>
						</ul>
						
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Definition of institutions </h2>
						<p class="fragment">"By and large, they define them as the formal or informal procedures, routines, norms and conventions embedded in the organizational structure of the polity or political economy." (p. 938) </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Focus on formal organisations, rules, and conventions. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Focus on assymmetrical power created by institutions. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Strong focus on path dependency and unintended consequences. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Often combine the influence of institutions with other explanaroty factors. </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Relationship between institutions and individual behaviour. </h2>
						<p class="fragment">Historical institutionalists embrace several answers to this question. </p>
						<p class="fragment">Two overall approaches: </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Calculus appraoch:</li>
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment">Instrumental and strategic calculation. </li>
								<li class="fragment">Institutions alter expectations that an actor has about the actions others are likely to take. </li>
								<li class="fragment">Thus institutions can provide more or less certainty about the present and futre. </li>
							</ul>
							<li class="fragment">Cultural approach: </li>
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment">Individuals are deeply embedded in a world composed of symbols, scripts and routines. </li>
								<li class="fragment">These provide filters for interpretation of the world. </li>
								<li class="fragment">And this again affects how actors behave. </li>
							</ul>						
						</ul>

					<h3 style="color: rgb(0,101,189)">Rational Choice Institutionalism </h3>
					<section>
						<h2>Origins </h2>
						<p class="fragment">Rational-choice refers to theories that assume humans are rational beings. (very simplified) </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Inspired by puzzle about collective actions problems. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Institutions lower the transaction-costs of makings deals, to allow outcomes that would otherwise be irrational. </li>
						</ul>
						
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Four characteristics: </h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Behavioural assumptions about fixed preferences. </li>
							<li class="fragment">See politics as a series of collective action dilemmas. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Emphasize the role of strategic interaction. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Institutions exists as voluntary agreements by individual actors. </li>
							<li class="fragment">The last point leads to a notion that insitutions only survive if they provide enough benefits to the relevant actors. </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3 style="color: rgb(0,101,189)">Sociological Institutionalism </h3>
					<section>
						<h2>Origins </h2>
						<p class="fragment">Comes from organistional theory in sociology. </p>
						<p class="fragment">Reaction against earlier notion that organisations evolved to become more efficient over time. </p>
						
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>More broad definition of institutions:</h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">No distinction between organisational "institutional" explenations and cultural explenations. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Redifinition of "culture" as a network of symbols, routines, and scripts rather than individual values or attitudes. </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Extreme focus on cultural approach:</h2>
						<p class="fragment">Institutions define... </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">..what is acceptable. </li>
							<li class="fragment">...but also what is even possible. </li>
						</ul>
						
						<p class="fragment">...which leads to a mutually-constitutive relationship between insitutions and individual action. </li>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Persistance of institutions </h2>
						<p class="fragment">A "logic of social appropiateness" instead of a "logic of appropriateness".</p>
						<p class="fragment">What is "legitimate" and "socially appropriate"?</p>
						<p class="fragment">A matter of cultural authority. </p>
