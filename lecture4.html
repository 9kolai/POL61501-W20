					<h3 style="color: rgb(0,101,189)">The role of citizens </h3>
					<section>
						<h2>What role should citizens play in political decision making? </h2>
						<p class="fragment">Democracy: Demos (people) + kratos (rule) = Rule by the people. </p>
						<p class="fragment">So citizens obviously ought to play <em>some</em> role in democracies. </p>
						<p class="fragment">So this is fundamentally a question of what democracy is. </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>What is democracy? </h2>
						<p class="fragment">A contested concept! </p>
						<p class="fragment">In fact, Jean-paul Gagnon identifes no less than 2234 distinct descriptions of democracy. </p>
						<p style="font-size:small">(Gagnon, J.-P., 2018. 2,234 Descriptions of Democracy: An Update to Democracy’s Ontological Pluralism. Democratic Theory 5, 92–113.)</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>A minimalist definition of democracy: </h2>
						<p class="fragment">People elect representatives in competitive elections to carry out their will. </p>
						<p class="fragment" style="font-size:small">Schumpeter, J.A., 1942. Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy (inspired by Max Weber)</p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">People are too ignorant and superficial to actually govern themselves. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Democracy as a competition between leaders (and their policies).</li>
							<li class="fragment">Importance of allowing leaders to rule when elected. </li>
							<li class="fragment">=> Very limited role for citizen participation beyond elections. </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Pluralist democracy and Polyarchy</h2>
						<p style="font-size:small">Dahl, R.A., 1956. A Preface to Democratic Theory  & Dahl, R.A., 1989. Democracy and its critics. </p>
						<p class="fragment">Five conditions for democracy (theoretical. According to Dahl no democracy perfectly meets all criteria):</p>
						<ol>
							<li class="fragment">Effective participation: Adequate and equal opportunity to form preferences. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Voting equality: One person, one vote </li>
							<li class="fragment">Enlightnened understanding: Opportunity for all to discover knowledge about choices. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Control of the agenda: Every citizens must have a say on what political matters are.  </li>
							<li class="fragment">Inclusiveness: Equal participation must extend to all citizens. </li>
						</ol>
						<p class="fragment">Polyarchies are imperfect democracies. All conditions are not met perfectly. </p>
						<p class="fragment">Citizen political engagement is more important, but citizen's key role is to elect elites. </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Participatory democracy </h2>
						<p class="fragment">A very broad range of theories that all stress the importance of active citizen involvement in politics in a democracy. </p>
						<p class="fragment">These views acknowledge the importance of a strong civil society to uphold a libearl democracy. </p>
						<p class="fragment">Carole Pateman is a strong proponent of participatory democracy, who argues that citizen participation in politics has two important outcomes: </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Policies that take all citizens into account. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Development of social and political capacities of individuals. </li>
						</ul>
						<p class="fragment">Ie. participation is a good in itself, that is required to create better citizens. </p>
						
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Deliberative democracy </h2>
						<p class="fragment">Democratic legitimacy comes from authentic deliberation, rather than voting! </p>
						<p class="fragment">The best argument should win, rather than the one with most support. </p>
						
						<p class="fragment">Some central authors: </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Jürgen Habermas </li>
							<li class="fragment">John Rawls (and Joshua Cohen)</li>
							<li class="fragment">James Fishkin</li>
							<li class="fragment">John Dryzek</li>
							<li class="fragment">Jane Mansbridge</li>
							<li class="fragment">...and many more</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="fragment">According to many, this has become the dominant notion of democracy in political theory. </p>
						
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>What is authentic deliberation? </h2>
						<p class="fragment">A lot of different notions of this, but Habermas' communicative rationality is often used as a basis. Reason giving, justification of opinions, and open-minded-ness play a role here. </p>
						<p class="fragment">Amy Gutmann and Dennis F. Thompson have developed four practical requirements for the reasons given in a deliberative democracy: </p>
						<ol>
							<li class="fragment">Reciprocal: Acceptable reasons to free and equal persons. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Accessible: Reasons must be public (and understandable)</li>
							<li class="fragment">Binding: The process should lead to a binding decision. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Dynamic or Provisional: An openness to change one's mind and reconsider previous decisions. </li>
						</ol>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>What is authentic deliberation? </h2>
						<p>Another example of concrete requirements to deliberation developed by James Fishkin and Robert Luskin: </p>
						<ol>
							<li class="fragment">Informed and informative: Based on (reasonable) factual claims. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Balanced: Arguments and counterarguments. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Conscientious: Willingness to listen as well as talk respectfully. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Substantive: Focus on substance of arguments and not performance. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Comprehensive: All relevant points and positions should be included. </li>
						</ol>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>The role of citizens in deliberative democracy</h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Preferences are not determined a priori!</li>
							<li class="fragment">So preference formation is a central part of political engagement. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Process legitimacy rather than output legitimacy: Political outcomes are justified by the deliberative process rather than the quality of their outputs. </li>
							<li class="fragment">So the process of deliberation is crucial!</li>
							<li class="fragment">Different emphasis on citizen participation in deliberation. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Focus on inclusion of arguments, rather than inclusion of people. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Representativeness might be more important than quantity (according to some deliberative theorists)</li>
						</ul>
