					<section>
						<h2>What is a Policy Cycle? </h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">A theoretical construction! </li>
							<li class="fragment">Prescriptive and normative rather than descriptive and analytical. </li>
							<li class="fragment">Attempts to split the process of policy formation into separate stages. </li>
							<li class="fragment">And thus serves a basic need to organise and systematise our understanding of this process. </li>
							<li class="fragment">But there are many opinions about which steps this process should be split into. </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Examples of (theories of) the policy cycle: </h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Laswell (1956):
								<ol>
									<li>Intelligence </li>
									<li>Promotion </li>
									<li>Prescription </li>
									<li>Invocation </li>
									<li>Application </li>
									<li>Termination </li>
									<li>Appraisal </li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li class="fragment">In the following decades, many scholard developed even more detailed versions with several sub-stages. </li>
							<li class="fragment">However, the main stages that has mostly been adopted in subsequent research are: 
								<ol>
									<li>Agenda-setting </li>
									<li>Policy formulation / analysis </li>
									<li>Decision making </li>
									<li>Implementation </li>
									<li>Evaluation </li>
								</ol>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>But when is a policy finished? </h2>
						<p class="fragment">What does it indicate that it is a cycle? </p>
						<p class="fragment">Evolved as a critique of normative notions of ideal policy making as a linear process. </p>
						<p class="fragment">Instead the circular perspective sees policy making as a constantly evolving process. </p>
						<p class="fragment">A key part here is the notion of feedback loops: Policy implementations and evaluations create new insights that feed back into the understanding of the policy problem. </p>
						<p class="fragment">So Laswell's cyclical model has two implications for our understanding of policy making: </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">It splits policy making into separate stages that can be studied individually. </li>
							<li class="fragment">It lets go of the notion that policies are the result of a clear linear process. </li>
						</ul>
						<p class="fragment">Instead of just comparing different institutions (as we did last week), this framework allow us to focus on (specific) processes. </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>When does each stage begin and end? </h2>
						<p class="fragment">Policy Cycle theories conceive policy making as a chronological order of processes. </p>
						<p class="fragment">But this should be understood as an ideal type, and not an accurate picture of real policy formation! </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Policy formation is messy and can jump between stages unpredictably. </li>
							<li class="fragment">The different stages tend to overlap each other in real life (policies are constantly reviewed, modified, and maybe even terminated at any point in the policy cycle). </li>
							<li class="fragment">Policies are not developed in vacuum (Hogwood and Peters, 1983). They are influenced and influences other policies that are subsequently developed/implemented/evaluated. </li>
							<li class="fragment">In addition to unintended consequences (with the feedback loop of a cycle model takes into account), policies also create new problems, that can cause new policies to emerge. </li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>So theories of policy cycles are inaccurate descriptions of policy formation. </p>
						<p class="fragment">...and for that reason does not work well as an analytical framework to explain policy outcomes. </p>
						<h2 class="fragment">But it allows us to focus our analysis on generic features of the policy process. </h2>
						<p class="fragment">As opposed to focussing on specific actors or institutions. </p>
						<p class="fragment">And this has resulted in useful theories and general findings about each of the policy stages. </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Stages of a conventional policy cycle: </h2>
						<ol>
							<li>Agenda-setting </li>
							<li>Policy formulation / analysis </li>
							<li>Decision making </li>
							<li>Implementation </li>
							<li>Evaluation </li>
						</ol>

				<section>
					<h3 style="color: rgb(0,101,189)">Agenda-setting </h3>
					<section>
						<h2>What is the "agenda"? </h2>
						<p class="fragment">Kingdon's (1995) definition: </p>
						<p class="fragment">"...the list of subjects or problems to which government officials, and people outside the government closely associated with those officials, are payinng some serious attention to at any given time." </p>
						<p class="fragment">Government (insitutional) agenda <-> media and public agenda (systemic) </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>And how is this agenda set? </h2>
						<p class="fragment">Assumption that not all problems can recieve the same level of (or any) attention. </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Recognition of problem </li>
							<li class="fragment">Take advantage of rising attention (for a variety of outside reasons) </li>
							<li class="fragment">Dramatising problems </li>
							<li class="fragment">Advancing particular definitions of problems/possible solutions. </li>
						</ul>
						<p class="fragment">Many actors involved, but outside control of any single actor. </p>
						<p class="fragment">Is this always true? </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p classs="fragment">Key is the move from recognition of problem to formal political agenda. </p>
						<h2 class="fragment">So are all problems recognised on the same conditions? </h2>
						<p class="fragment">Does agenda reflect "real" severety of "real" issues? </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Outside-initiation (social actors gain public support) </li>
							<li class="fragment">Inside-initiation (Lobbyinng with direct access to government officials) </li>
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment">European agricultural policies. </li>
							</ul>
							<li class="fragment">Gvoernment mobilisations (top-down without relevant role for non-state actors) </li>
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment">The introduction of the Euro. </li>
							</ul>
							<li class="fragment">Consolidation (state initiation of already popular issue) </li>
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment">German unification. </li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Possible explanatory factors of agenda-setting: </h2>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Actors (who are engaging and how are they engaging?) </li>
							<li class="fragment">Institutions (what institutional context?)</li>
							<li class="fragment">Ideas </li>
							<li class="fragment">Material conditions </li>
						</ul>
						<p class="fragment">But how does these interact? </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Kingdon's multiple streams model </h2>
						<p class="fragment">Builds on garbage can model of organisational choice. </p>
						<ul class="fragment">
							<li>Solutions </li>
							<li>Problems </li>
							<li>Actors </li>
							<li>Decision opportunities </li>
						</ul>
						<h3 class="fragment">Windows of opportunity</h3>
						<p class="fragment">These open up when the following intersect: </p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Policy stream (solutions) </li>
							<li class="fragment">Politics stream </li>
							<li class="fragment">Problem stream (problem perception) </li>
						</ul>
